Partials
========

Partials are files that we intend to **@import** 

## Best Practices
Partials should be independent of any other styles. They're essentially components. This is **very** useful.

### Practical Examples
- All Template Sections should be a partial
- Fonts shoudl be partials
- Grids should be partials
- Reset should be a partial
- Global Variables and Mixins should be partials

**Other Examples include...**
- You can compartmentalize themes for sections. Examples:
	+ You're testing out Banner Styles
	+ You're trying out a new lightbox design
	+ Testing out fonts.
	+ Seasonal Color Changes
	+ Etc.
- You can share Page styles that aren't part of the primary site. Example:
	+ A grid system for a brands landing page
	+ Special form designs for sweepstakes pages
	+ Awesome UX designed templates
	+ Etc.
